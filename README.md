# nvim

My Neovim (`0.9.4`) configuration built from scratch with Lua.

## Tools

1. Telescope as fuzzy finder (it integrates nicely with the native LSP config)
2. Ripgrep for recursively searches directories for a regex pattern efficiently
   while respecting my `.gitignore`.
3. Native LSP with `nvim-cmp`
4. Treesitter for nice text highlighting.
